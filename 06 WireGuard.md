# Configuring WireGuard
This section will show you how to add the WireGuard package to pfSense and then how to use the Mullvad configuration files to setup WireGuard to build your encrypted tunnels.

## WireGuard Package
- The first thing you need to do is add the WireGuard package to pfSense. In pfSense, navigate to `System` > `Package Manager` > `Available Packages` then scroll down to the WireGuard link and click on `Install`. On the next page click on `Confirm`. The installer will run and let you know when it has successfully completed.

- Now you can navigate to `VPN` > `WireGuard` and confirm that the package has been installed but nothing is configured yet.

- Now navigate back to pfSense and go to `VPN` > `WireGuard` > `Settings` and click on `Enable WireGuard` and then `Save`.

## WireGuard Tunnels

- Navigate to the `Tunnels` tab and select `Add Tunnel`.

- Open your first Mullvad configuration file with a text editor like Notepad and keep it to the side. 
- In WireGuard, add a `Description` for your tunnel that describes what it is, like `Mullvad Atlanta US167`.
- Copy/paste the `PrivateKey` from the Mullvad configuration file and add it to the `Interface Keys` dialog box.
- Click on `Save Tunnel`, then `Apply Changes` at the top of the page.

WireGuard will automatically generate the public key when you paste the private key and hit the `tab` key on your keyboard. You can verify the public key was correctly generated by comparing it to the key on the Mullvad website that you generated earlier.

Repeat this process for as many tunnels as you want. Make sure you use the correct Mullvad configuration file for each one as they all contain different public/private key pairs, IP addresses, and endpoints. 

## WireGuard Peers
Each tunnel will get its own peer. You can add a peer by first navigating to the `Peer` tab next to the `Tunnels` tab that you were just on. Then click on `Add Peer`.

![](assets/WireGuard5.png)

-Select the appropriate tunnel from the drop-down menu for this peer. 
- Add a `Description` for your peer that describes what it is, like `Mullvad Atlanta US167`. 
- Uncheck the `Dynamic Endpoint` box. 
- Copy/Paste the `Endpoint` IP address & Port from the Mullvad configuration file into the `Endpoint` fields in WireGuard. 
- You can give 30 seconds to the `Keep Alive` field. 
- Copy/Paste the `PublicKey` from the Mullvad configuration file into the `Public Key` field in WireGuard. 
- Change the `Allowed IPs` to `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4. You can also add a descriptor like `Allow All IPs` if you want. 
- Click on `Save`. Then select `Apply Changes` at the top of the page.

Repeat this process for as many peers as you have tunnels. Make sure you use the correct Mullvad configuration file for each one as they all contain different public/private key pairs, IP addresses, and endpoints. 

At this point, you should be able to navigate to the `Status` tab and observe the handshakes taking place by clicking on `Show Peers` in the lower right-hand corner.

## Interfaces
Next, the interfaces need to be assigned for each tunnel. This is similar to how you assigned interfaces to each LAN. 

- Navigate to `Interfaces` > `Interface Assignments`. 
- Select each tunnel from the drop down menu and add it to your list. 

![](assets/WireGuard8.png)

- After all your tunnels are added,  click on the blue hyperlink next to each added tunnel to configure the interface. 
- Click on the `Enable Interface` box. 
- Enter your description, for example: `Mullvad_Atlanta_US167`. 
- Select `Static PIv4`. 
- Type `1420` in the `MTU & MSS` boxes. 
- Now copy/paste the host IP address from your Mullvad configuration file in the `IPv4 Address` dialog box. 
- Then click on on `Add A New Gateway`.

![](assets/WireGuard9.png)

After clicking on `Add A New Gateway`, you will be presented with this pop-up dialog. Enter a name for your new gateway, something easy like the name of your tunnel appended with `GW` for "GateWay". Then enter the same host IP address from the Mullvad configuration file. You can also add a description if you want such as `Mullvad Atlanta US167 Gateway`. Then click on `Add`.

Once you are back at the Interface Configuration page, click on `Save` at the bottom of the page. Then click on `Apply Changes` at the top of the page.

Repeat that process to configure each tunnel interface you added. Make sure you use the correct Mullvad configuration file for each one as they all contain different host IP addresses. 

## Gateway DNS
At this point, you can navigate to your dashboard and monitor the status of your gateways. If you have not done so already you can customize your dashboard to monitor several stats in pfSense. Click on the `+` sign in the upper right-hand corner of your dashboard and then a list of available stat monitors will drop down and you can select the ones you want. 

![](assets/Dashboard0.png)

In the `Gateways` section, you will notice that all the Gateways are online. The gateways will be online so long as the tunnel is active. Even if the remote side is not responding. This is because they are the local interface, so right now they are useless since even if the remote side goes down, they will still show as online. In order to enable the ability to monitor latency so that these gateways can provide some useful stats, they need to be given a public Domain Name System (DNS) address to monitor.  

You'll notice that all the tunnel ping times are `0ms`. That's because no data is being sent out through these tunnels. By pinging a public DNS server, pfSense can get some useful metrics and make decisions about which tunnel will provide the least latency or if a remote server goes down to re-rout traffic. 

You can find a public DNS server to monitor at [this website](https://dnschecker.org/public-dns) or a number of other public DNS server listings. Watch for the recorded uptime percentage, the more the better. You want to find public DNS IPv4 IP addresses to monitor on your IPv4 gateways. Each gateway will need a separate DNS address to monitor.  

![](assets/WireGuard13.png)

- Once you have your public DNS addresses, Navigate to `System` > `Routing` > `Gateways` in pfSense. 
- Click on the pencil icon next to your gateway. 
- You can see that the `Gateway Address` and the `Monitor IP` address are the same on all the gateways. That is why the ping time is 0ms and this is also why pfSense will think the gateway is always up.   

![](assets/WireGuard14.png)

- Enter the public DNS IP address you want to monitor in the `Monitor IP` field and then click on `Save` at the bottom of the screen. 
- Then click on `Apply Changes` at the top of the screen. Remember, gateways cannot share the same DNS monitor address so use a different public DNS server for each gateway to monitor.
